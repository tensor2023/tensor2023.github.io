I created and maintain the open resource:  
🌐 **[Awesome Computational Imaging](https://tensor2023.github.io/Awesome-Computational-Imaging/index.html)**

> A curated learning and implementation series on modern computational imaging — bridging physical models and deep learning.

## 🔍 Why This Project?

As an undergraduate in **Optoelectronics** with a passion for **deep learning**, I found it difficult to find unified resources for topics like:

- Inverse problems in scientific imaging
- Physics-informed neural networks
- Neural field representations (e.g., NeRF, SIREN, FFN)
- Diffusion-based image restoration
- Plug-and-play methods in computational optics

Most tutorials were either:
- Too theoretical, or
- Lacked code-level explanations

## 📚 What’s Included

The website contains **modular learning units**, each with:

- 📖 **Theory**: Core concepts & physical models  
- 💡 **Code**: Simple yet extensible PyTorch implementations  
- 🧪 **Applications**: Imaging tasks like deblurring, phase retrieval, envelope removal, and more  
- 🧵 **Trends**: From NeRF and SIREN to diffusion-based inverse solvers (e.g., DPS, ILVR)
